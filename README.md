# MultiRobot
Stanford SPCS Final project - Multi-robot grid navigation.

This project makes robots navigate from one intersection on a grid to another, while avoiding collisions with one another, and following the black lines on the grid. All robots follow the optimal path to their destination. Relevant explanations can be found in the code.
